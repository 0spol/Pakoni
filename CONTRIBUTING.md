### Branch Naming Convention

When working on a new feature or task, please follow this branch naming convention before merging to the `main` branch:

- **Feature Branches**:  
  Use the prefix `fet/` followed by a descriptive name of the feature being developed.  
  Examples:
    - `fet/login` (For implementing the login functionality)
    - `fet/profile` (For adding user profile features)

- **Configuration Branches**:  
  Use the prefix `conf/` for branches that involve configuration changes.  
  Examples:
    - `conf/firebase` (For setting up Firebase configuration)

- **Design Branches**:  
  Use the prefix `design/` for design-related changes or improvements.  
  Examples:
    - `design/lookbetter` (For enhancing the visual design of the app)

#### How to Make a Commit

1. **Commit Header:**  
   Choose one of the following options based on the type of change made:

    - `ADD`: For adding new features or files.
    - `FIX`: For fixing errors or bugs.
    - `REFACTOR`: For modifying code without changing its functionality.
    - `DELETE`: For removing code, files, or other entities.
    - `DOCS`: For changes related to documentation.

2. **Commit Content:**  
   Inside the parentheses `()`, specify what was modified in the commit.

3. **Commit Summary:**  
   After `:`, provide a brief and clear summary of the change made.

#### Additional Notes

- Keep commit messages clear and concise.
- Use present tense in the summary (`Implemented`, `Fixed`, `Refactored`, `Deleted`, `Documented`) to indicate the action taken.
- Ensure each commit represents a logical and coherent change in the code or documentation.
